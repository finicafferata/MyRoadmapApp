# My Roadmap App

### Presentation
Hi! I am working on my first solo project where I want to practice everything I learnt in Soy Henry Bootcamp: My Roadmap App.
This website's objective is to let users register their trips and share their memories with friends and families. 
I am using Mapbox to render the maps and navigate the world, as they say.

### Future functionalities
As this project is still WIP, I wrote down some functionalities I want to develop. Users will be able to:
- Register and login.
- Follow other people.
- Register their trips, place by place they visited and upload photos for each of these places.
- View someone else's trips, like and comment.
- Check the weather of their favorites cities.

> Please, feel free to check this project and suggest new functionalities or fixes. 

### Available Scripts
> To run it, please do it over the master branch. I will be working on the dev branch and merging after a new functionality is done.
